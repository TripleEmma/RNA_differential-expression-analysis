# RNA_differential-expression-analysis
We want to detect genes differentially expressed in two color morphs of species *Gomphocerus sibiricus*.

It is an opportunity for me to learn the principle behind this kind of analysis and get first hand practices.

# Attain assembly from raw fq data (fq files have been check with FastQC) via Trinity
# potential problem is that there too many sequences

## Quantification via salmon or RSEM
# results of RSEM and salmon is highly correlated (r = 0.88, p = 0)

## Differential expression analysis via DEseq2 (R package)
